                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripted language.
                    JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a
                    small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
                    developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript
                    lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it
                    can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
                    programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <a href="">Variable Decleration</a> JavaScript variables are
                            containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with
                            coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All
                            JavaScript variables must be identified with unique means. These
                            unique names are called identifiers.<span>var x;</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign
                            values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee
                            poured in it, giving out variable a value to hold. The =
                            assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span>var x = 10;</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to
                            be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
                            There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean,
                            - <span>true</span> or <span>false</span>; <span>null</span> - null aka nothing;
                             Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159</span>;
                            String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span>
                            and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>

                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform
                            different actions for different decisions - hitting different code
                            blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met. You can
                            use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.
                            There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified
                            condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify
                            a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span> we execute
                            this block of code;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming
                            language, but essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some
                            number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track
                            four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. 
                            When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as 
                            a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk 
                            from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the 
                            legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done! We finished 
                            out instructions. Sadly there a a ton more table to do so lets call our function 
                            over and over again.
                        </p>
                    </li>
